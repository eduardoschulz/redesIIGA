abstract = {For many years, small groups of computers have been interconnected in various ways. Only recently, however, has the interaction of computers and communications become an important topic in its own right. In 1968, after considerable preliminary investigation and discussion, the Advanced Research Projects Agency of the Department of Defense (ARPA) embarked on the implementation of a new kind of nationwide computer interconnection known as the ARPA Network. This network will initially interconnect many dissimilar computers at ten ARPA-supported research centers with 50-kilobit common-carrier circuits. The network may be extended to include many other locations and circuits of higher bandwidth.},
